There are two types of code in this folder:

1) One is DQN code, this code constructs the DQN agent and performs the training for a given case study,
2) The second is the simulation code, where the trained DQN is tested multiple times and features of the culled farms are recorded.

The code for each case study is nearly the same, with the exception of the data used.
